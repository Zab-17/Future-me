<p>I just Failed in my <strong> first </strong>big plan to be successful and rich. I tried to get a scholarship to any US college, but unfortunately I<strong> couldnt </strong>do it. Although I had <em>four</em> different scholarship oppurtunities, none of them were good enough. However, I've decied not to be a<strong> victim </strong>of the system nor the circumastances. I've decided to create my own reality by working my ass off to achieve evrything I want. I have taken an oath that I hold true to not let anything stop me from trying, That includes my <em>Laziness</em>. I have also taken an oath to not lose my Faith and become <em>Secular</em> in the process.</p>
